## Exercise 2: Infrastructure As Code

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will explore and understand the structure and contents of the IaC folder, which contains all the scripts and templates necessary to correctly perform this and other exercises in this lab, using a best practices model.

### Technology Overview - Infrastructure As Code Practice

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology) in a descriptive model, using the same versioning as DevOps team uses for source code. Like the principle that the same source code generates the same binary, an IaC model generates the same environment every time it is applied. IaC is a key DevOps practice and is used in conjunction with continuous delivery. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/deliver/what-is-infrastructure-as-code)

### Task 1: Understanding the IaC folder

In this task you will explore and understand the folder structure and scripts, templates contained in it for execution in IaC.

To proceed with the execution of the other exercises below, you must understand the structure of the "infrastructure-as-code" folder, as well as its content of templates and scripts.

### Technology Overview - Azure Resource Manager Templates

To implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions, use Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources. (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview)

# Folder [infrastructure]

```
|infrastructure|
		|linkedTemplates|
			|compute|
				template.json
			|data|
				template.json
			|ml|
				template.json
			|roleAssigments|
				compute.json
				data.json
		|parameters|
			parameters.dev.json
			parameters.dev.template.json
			parameters.prod.json
			parameters.prod.template.json
			parameters.qa.json
			parameters.qa.template.json
		azuredeploy.json
```
# File: azuredeploy.json
Main template, with declared parameters, variables and resources. Here we use linkedTemplates.
*NOTE*: We have the option of using separate parameter files as a good practice when using IaC templates, without the need to change directly in the main template.

```

In linkedTemplates we have templates with "parts" of declared resources that are not declared in the main Template, in order to reuse and can link with other templates.
*NOTE*: linkedTemplates is a widely used practice, for better organization and handling of templates of different types of resources and being able to link them to any template.

```

Parameters folder and directory with templates files with parameters and values to be used by linkedTemplates and main template, without the need to change directly in the main template.
*NOTE*: Using templates parameters is optional and can be used directly in the main template. However, following a model of good practice, the use separately is indicated.

### Task 2: Creating a new sandbox environment with Powershell

In this task you will learn how to create your first sandbox environment, with Azure Powershell scripts.

### Task 3: Checklist of IaC best practices

In this task you will understand the best practices in creating, executing and managing scripts and templates in IaC.

1. Codify everything

2. Document as little as possible

3. Maintain version control
Version your templates in a code repository, such as Azure Repos, GitHub, etc.
By versioning your templates you can control and reuse them with your development team or infrastructure at any time, in addition to ensuring the version history.

4. Continuously test, integrate, and deploy

5. Make your infrastructure code modular

6. Make your infrastructure immutable (when possible)


## Exercise 3: Git Workflow and CI/CD

Duration: 45 minutes

## Exercise 4: Semantic Versioning of Data Engineering Libraries

Duration: 25 minutes

In the DataOps culture, the data engineer team moves at lightning speed using highly optimized methodology, tools, and processes. One of the most important productivity methodologies is the ability to reuse codes. When we talk about reusing code, we mean about the approach to reuse data engineering codes that are responsible to do default data transformations for your data sets. 

When we talk about data engineering approach in a data analytics project, automatically we think about [Notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface). Use notebooks is good to analyze, make experimentations and apply techniques of curate data in the pipelines. However oftentimes in a project it can become a manually task, as a copy and paste codes across notebooks.  To address necessities like this, optimize the processes and save the time, we can develop custom libraries to abstract these data engineering practices, and use them around the notebooks.

In this exercise you will learn how to implement a semantic versioning using a custom library in Python.

### Exploring the Databricks Notebook

Open the **02 One Notebook to Rule them all** notebook (located in the Workspace Databricks, under Notebookâs area) and run it step by step to complete this first step. Some of the most important tasks you will perform are:
	â¢  Install and import a custom python library
	â¢  Prepare and apply data quality in the flight delays and whether data sets.
	â¢ Transform and combining dates columns between flights delay and whether forecast data set using the custom python library

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
_Please note that each of these tasks will be addressed through several cells in the notebook. You donât need to change them only execute and analyze the transformation operations._

### Exploring the Python custom libraries. 

In previous exercise we explored the databricks notebook, and we used a custom library responsible for the main transformations in the data sets of flights delays and whether. Now, letâs to explore and understand some approaches to creating custom libraries in data analytics projects.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**
_Please note that we will use existing custom libraries in the repository, wonât be necessary to develop a new library to this exercise._

**For the remainder of this guide, the following pre-requirements will be necessary to execute and validate the library locally:**

*	Python 3.x
*	Docker + Docker Compose
*	Java SDK
*	Visual Studio Code

1. Open the HOL directory in your prompt and execute **âcode .â**  to open the Visual Studio Code:

_[Image]_


2. From the left explorer view, open the **âdata-platform/srcâ** directory structure. 


_[Image]_

3. Inside the structure you will have all items necessary to develop and validate a custom library. To proceed with the validation, we will investigate the existing library used in the databricks notebook. For that, open the **âsparkâ** directory and click on the file **âdata_transformation.pyâ**

_[Image]_

4. If you look in the code library, will notice that there is a lot of functions that is used in the databricks notebooks to address data cleanings and transformations. Letâs look at one of them. Press *CTRL+F* type **âmake_datetime_columnâ** and click OK. You will see that in this part of the code, we are using is a pretty common practice for some datasets:

_[Image]_


5.	From the left menu explorer, you will see others library, but before to execute and test them locally you will need to setup the configuration of the environment. For that, follow the steps **6** and **7**.


6. Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

    ```sh
      python3 -m venv dataopslib_env
      source dataopslib_env/bin/activate

      pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. Open the `spark` folder on your terminal and run the Docker compose to start an Apache Spark instance locally:

    ```sh
       docker-compose up
    ```


8. Now we already have the environment prepared and to start the execution of some existing libraries. Choose more one sample to test, open the samples folder, click on the file **âsample_read_csv.pyâ** and press F5.


_[Image]_

9. Now let's imagine that we need to add a new function to address new functionalities in our pipeline. We could add this new feature in the library and promote that to our pipeline. Here the intention is just to show how is the process to promote to QA, so letâs to add a simple code:

    ```
    def `make_datetime_column_new`(df: DataFrame, columnName: str, year: str, month: str, day: str,
                         hour: Union[str, None] = None, minute: Union[str, None] = None,
                         second: Union[str, None] = None, time: [str, None] = None,
                         timeFormat: str = 'HH:mm:ss') -> DataFrame:
     ```


10. Until we were able to abstract certain functions inside a library and reuse them in the notebooks. But now, letâs imagine that we need to create a new feature for this library, or maybe fix a bug, how to versioning this code? Let's to learn that in the next exercise.

## Exercise 5: Testing  {#Exercise-5-Testing}

Duration: 25 minutes

### Task 1: Understanding test types

  Testing data pipelines has unique challenges that makes it different from testing traditional software. You have data pipelines that pulls data from many source systems, ensure data quality (i.e. ensure that bad data is identified, then blocked, scrubbed, fixed, or just logged), combines this data, transforms and scrubs it. Then the data is stored in some processed state for consumption by downstream systems, analytics platforms, or data scientists. These pipelines often process data from *hundreds* or even *thousands* of sources. You run your pipelines and get *several* million new rows in your consumption layer.

  Then you create full end-to-end functional tests for the pipelines. The pipelines are getting more complex over time, and the tests are becoming harder to understand and maintain. Then you start thinking:

  * How to make the tests as readable as possible?
  * How to improve tests maintainability?
  * *How to effectively communicate the **current behavior** of the data pipelines with the team or across teams?*

  Leveraging the concepts of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) could be the answer for these questions. BDD uses **human-readable** descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests, where we define a shared vocabulary between stakeholders, domain experts, and engineers. This process involves the definition of entities, events, and outputs that the users care about, and giving them names that everybody can agree on.

  **Testing Strategy**

  *Language and Frameworks*

  Data engineers and data scientists are turning decisively to Python - according to the [O'Reilly annual usage analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/oreilly-2020-platform-analysis/) - due to its applicability and its tools for data analysis and ML/AI.

  For this reason, the tests in this repository are written in Python using the most used open-source BDD framework called [behave](https://github.com/behave/behave). The framework leverages the use of [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) to write tests, a well-known language used in BDD designed to be human readable.

  *Structure of tests*

  Essentially the test files are structured in two levels:

  * **Features**: Files where we specify the expected behavior of the data pipelines based on the existing requirements that can be understood by all people involved (e.g. data engineers, data scientists, business analysts). The specifications are written in Gherkin format.
  * **Steps**: Files where we implement the scenarios defined on feature files. These files are written in Python.

  >On the next Task of this lab, you will explore an example that it is already implemented as part of the full solution deployment. (See Exercise 3)

### Task 2: Understanding BDD tests

> **Prerequiste for this task:** Succesful completion of Excersise 3

Objective of this Task: Review how a Pipeline test was configured and explore the results of the BDD execution.

First review how the DevOps pipeline was defined:

  1. Go to the repositoy that was created as part the Exercise 3, Task # and open the templates folder, were you will see 3 yml files.

!['Templastes Folder'](media/templates-folder.png)

  2. Open the test.yml file by clicking on it

!['Test yml'](media/select-test-yml.png)

  3. Indentify the script activity that runs the behave modulo and identify the different paramentes that are set before it is called

!['Behave activity'](media/behave-script.png)

Now lets review the DevOps pipeline execution results:
  
  1. Go to DevOps Pipelines from the project defined on Execise 3 and select the Pipeline with the name "*\<your lab prefix>*-adf-cd" by clciking on it.

!['Last Pipeline Run'](media/last-pipeline-run.png) 

  2. You will see a list of resent runs of the selected pipeline, click on the lates run

  3. At the stages secction select the "Run behavior tests" stage

 !['Pipeline Stages'](media/pipeline-stages-run.png) 
  
  4. Review the Azure DevOps execution results for "Run behavior tests"\\"TEST: Run behave features"

  !['Pipeline Results'](media/pipeline-run-results.png)

  <p>Here you see the results of running the BDD test using <b>behave</b></p>

> On the next optional task you could explore how to build your own Data Pipeline BDD test
### Task 3: Developing a new test (Optional)

> **Prerequiste for this task:** Have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed and configured to run Python 3.7 projects - this setup is out of scope of this lab

Objective of this Task: Explore how Behavior Driven Development is implemented with "behave" framework

  1. Go to your Development environment were you have installed VS Code and clone the data-platform repo that is part of the HOL

  2. Go to src directory and read the readme.md

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 5 minutes

### Task 1: Delete resource group

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), delete the resource group you created for this lab.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
