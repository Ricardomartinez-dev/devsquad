# DevSquad In a Day

Margie's Travel (MT) provides concierge services for business travelers. In an increasingly crowded market, they are always looking for ways to differentiate themselves and provide added value to their corporate customers.

Recently they've developed a POC for a web app that their internal customer service agents can use to provide additional valuable information to the traveler during the flight booking process. On that, POC they've enabled their agents to enter in the flight information and produce a prediction as to whether the departing flight will encounter a 15-minute or longer delay, considering the weather forecast for the departure hour. Now they want to evaluate deploy the project to production, leveraging DataOps & Software Engineering best practices.
